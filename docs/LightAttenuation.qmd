-   The intensity of light decreases underwater as depth increases due to the scattering and absorption of incoming light

-   Light intensity sensors are used to determine the amount of light at 0.5m intervals under the water surface

-   Graphing this produces a light attenuation curve

    -   Taking the natural log of this curve gives a linear relationship, the slope of which is our light attenuation coefficient (kd)

-   Light attenuation is important due to the significance of light in determining dominant primary producers

-   Waterbodies with little clarity, phytoplankton typically dominates primary production

    -   This leads to more frequent harmful algal blooms, the release of toxins, and less aquatic vegetation

-   Waterbodies with high clarity are able to better support colonies of submerged aquatic vegetation

    -   These help reduce present nutrients and prevent sediment resuspension
